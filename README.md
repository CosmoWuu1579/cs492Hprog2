# Prog 2 by Cosmo Wu cyw356 

## How to Run

First run ./build.sh and then just do ./hw2 {source}.txt

## Testing Code

My testing code is in testing.c's main method and can be read. I made 3 circuits for running.
There are also many commented out code and methods for printing to test my code and make sure they're right.
